In short, the terror of human freedom-the thing they coveted most of all. Romance offered writers not less but more; not a narrow a-historical canvas but a wide historical one; not escape but entanglement. For young America it had everything: nature as  subject matter, a system of symbolism, a thematics of the search for self-valorization andvalidation-above all, the opportunity to conquer fear imaginatively and to quiet deep insecurities. It offered platforms for moralizing and fabulation, and for the imaginative entertainment of violence, sublime incredibility, and terror-and terror's most significant, overweening ingredient: darkness, with all the connotative value it awakened.</p>                        <p style="padding: 5px; text-align: right"><i>Playing in the Dark</i><br>Toni morrison</p>                    </td>                    <td width="10px"></td>                    <td rowspan="6" style="border: 1px solid #000; padding: 5px" width="350px">                        <p style="padding: 5px">I’ve been taught bloodstones can cure a snakebite,<br>can stop the bleeding—most people forgot this<br>when the war ended.
